Dataset description
---
Dataset used to classify Dhaka has been generated by AGenCy Lab. Bing-Dhaka dataset contains 1900 images. The image acquired was from Bing Satellite image. Tested version of the dataset was given same 5 classes(Forest, Farmland, Water, Built-Up and Meadow).

Image Details
---
According to Bing, users are expected to find high resolution aerial images of 15-30cm (meaning that each screen pixel equals 6-12 inches on the ground) from Bing satellite depending on the area. The Dhaka image was obtained using the coordinates of the Sentinel-2 tile that covers Dhaka region. From that tile we extracted the coordinates which are, Upper Left - N24°23'04",E89°57'26" and Lower Right - N23°22'13", E91°00'26". This gives an image of resolution of  48906x47256. Dhaka City was extracted from the whole image and it was used only for testing, Dhaka city in dimension was 8721x13851. The rest of the data e.g. Dhaka Division except Dhaka city was used for training purposes only.

Annotation Process
---
Annotation for the Bing-Dhaka dataset was done using the eCognition software. A rule-set was made specific to this task. This rule-set contained 10 labels for annotation. But to maintain consistency with other dataset like GID, these 10 classes were converted to 5 classes, same as the GID’s 5 classes. These 10 labels are given below along with its converted class label.


| Index Value   | Original 11 Class | Converted 6 Class |
